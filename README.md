Project assignment in the course "DH2642  Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web". 

Working in a group of max four. You must join one of the pre-existing groups in Canvas. When you check the groups page you will first see the Lab groups, you need to use the search to find the Project groups. Do not create your own groups (using + Group button in upper right corner) as you will not be able to submit the projects in the assignments using those groups.  As a group you should design and implement an interactive application that uses some existing API and builds interactive features on top of it. More details on project requirements in the project proposal assignment.
